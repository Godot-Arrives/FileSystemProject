So I will be happy to do the write up that’s due Friday. I am sure it does not need to be exact because we all know implementation usually ends up being a little different than design. If you want to submit any ideas or thoughts I can write the paper and send it back to everybody for review before I submit it. 
A few points to address:
1.	Are we doing the garbage collector for bonus points? I would like to try because I need the points, but I really have no idea how it would work.
2.	We should probably address a few things from ch7 (at least in the write up). Mabey protection, sharing, and organization.
3.	For the open file list mentioned above in main memory. Is this a list of table structures containing name, pointer, size….? Role/service
4.	It also looks like we have fixed length blocks (correct me if I am wrong). What happens if the file is bigger than the block? I am not sure if he will test that feature, but maybe we can do some kind of test if file size>block, pointer to end of file, pointer to new block….etc…
5.	When the garbage collector is used, will it access the used space table, set the data back to all ones, remove from file allocation table/file list, and add to free space table?
6.	Should we have a method to keep free and used space contiguous, or do we not care because blocks are fixed size?

Just thinking out loud. Let me know what you think!
