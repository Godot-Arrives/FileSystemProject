	fopen()
	
		If filename is already in open file list
			return null, set error
			
		Verify that FAT is in memory by checking record 0 for FAT self-reference
		
		If FAT not in memory
			call function to build FAT, FSAT, USAT
			return null, set error
			
		Pull FAT index block
		
		Starting at record 3, first valid user file record
			search for matching filename in record
			
		If record is found before the end of FAT
			Build FILE structure for this file
			Set filepointer to beginning of file
			Set Acces type as specified by user
			Add to open file list
			Return FILE*
			
		Else
			Append new record containing this filename to end of FAT
			Allocate this file 1 index block and 1 data block from FSAT
			Build FILE structure for this file
			Return FILE*

		If filename is not in open file list
			return failure, set error
